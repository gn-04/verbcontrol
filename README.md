# verbcontrol
This is a web app built with Javascript, HTML and CSS while utilizing local storage in the browser. It allows the user to schedule their day by assigning certain activities to certian times. The user can also designate certain activities as either challenges (by selecting the Dragon icon in the options tray) or a reward (by selecting the Diamond icon). The idea is to help people have productive days by maintaining a scheudule that challenges AND rewards them.

In the future, I will likley rebuild this app with React and Node plus an actual database.
